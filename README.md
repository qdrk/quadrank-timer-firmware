# Overview
This repo hosts all the firmware for the QuadRank timer hardware.
For instructions on how to build the timer. Please refer to [http://qdrk-timer.huu.la](http://qrdk-timer-cn.huu.la).

Project is inspired by Delta 5 Race Timer: https://github.com/scottgchin/delta5_race_timer but should be considerably easier to build.
